Built a full-stack web application for managing property listings and reviews. The application
includes features for displaying, adding, editing, and deleting listings, with an interactive map
to show locations. Users can authenticate securely, add and delete reviews, while images are
stored using Cloudinary and data is stored in MongoDB Atlas. Featuring a beautiful UI,
responsive and intuitive navigation, the project is developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
Bootstrap, Express, and Node.js within an MVC framework.
